I was kinda start to think about distribution of the auto charge station(tower) for autonomous delivery drones accross NYC.

Main purpose of the problem is to making more efficient to deliver small packages with drones, but in order to do that 
we need to increase flight time of the drones without their coming back to base for recharging. 

We can take as a customers: USPS, UPS, Fedex etc.

Drones will leave from base (USPS, UPS, Fedex Distribution facilities) in the morning and they return the base when they compeletly delivered
all the package that they carry. However drones flight time is really limitted (approximately 30-45 minutes). For delivering more package
in the given area they need to stop few times on recharging stations( approxamitaly 45 minutes) during the day, and after that they need to continue
to deliver rest of the load they have.

we assume that we will put recharging stations accross the NYC, for drones, and try to optimize number of stations.
